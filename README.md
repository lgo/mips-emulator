MIPS emulator
==================================
This emulator is meant to be an asset for the [C-style compiler](https://github.com/xLegoz/compiler) being developed. It will support a subset of the MIPS assembly language. It is being developed with testing of programs as a huge part consideration, so native test excecution and profiling will be parts of this emulator.
